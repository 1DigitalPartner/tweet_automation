## About Lyzr
Lyzr is the simplest agent framework to help customers build and launch Generative AI apps faster. It is a low-code agent framework that follows an **‘agentic’** way to build LLM apps, contrary to Langchain’s ‘functions and chains’ way and DSPy’s ‘programmatic’ way of building LLM apps.
